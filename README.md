# Robots.txt Specification Test

This project aims to allow for any implementation of a robots.txt parser to be
tested and have some confidence that it adheres to the standard, as specified by
the [internet draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-koster-rep).

## Development

### Prerequisites

You need Maven to build this project.
[Download](https://maven.apache.org/download.html) and
[install](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) it from the official website.

You can also install it like this if your Linux supports it:

```
$ sudo apt-get install maven
```

You will also need to have the
[protocol buffer](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) compiler
([protoc](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf)) installed.
Get [the latest](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/latest)
for your platform (i.e. `protoc-x.x.x-win64.zip`, `protoc-x.x.x-osx-x86_64.zip`).

You can also install it like this if your Linux supports it:

```
$ sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler
```

### Build it

Standard maven commands work here.

```
$ mvn install
```

Or if you want a build from scratch:

```
$ mvn clean install
```

### Run it

```
$ mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.google.search.robotstxt.App" -Dexec.args="arg0 arg1"
```
